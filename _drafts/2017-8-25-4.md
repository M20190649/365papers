_Your tweet is very important to us and will be answered in the order in which it was received._

I recommend reading [this post](https://hardikbansal.github.io/CycleGANBlog/) as well, which explains much of the computer science in a look-at-code sort of way.

This paper introduces CycleGANs — a system that pits NNs against each other to alternatingly ① generate an image $G(X)$ from a base-image set $X$ as a "best-guess", and ② "grade" that image for how well it fits into a set $Y$, and then ③ compare how well that converted image $G(X)$ can be converted back into the starting image so that $F(G(X))$ most closely approximates original $X$ (the titular "cycle").

As this is a codebase I've used in Real Life, the _Results_ section was less interesting to me than the rationale and the underlying computer science (although the _Results_ section of this paper is one of the most visually appealing of anything I've ever read).

In particular: Something that struck me from reading this original paper was the significance of the jump from paired- to unpaired translation, which seemed to me before as a logical ability for a GAN... That other methods like `pix2pix` _don't_ have this capability is something I completely failed to appreciate until now.

Had I not gone back to the literature and read this paper, I wouldn't have ever realized that huge hole in my understanding of the importance of this work. Thanks [@brannondorsey](https://twitter.com/brannondorsey)!
