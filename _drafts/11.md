summary: We can extrapolate how many dinosaur species there were using what we know about sampling bias, geological conditions, and the data from actual found fossils.

The authors of this paper propose _TRiPS_, or "True Richness estimated using a Poisson Sampling model," a technique they use to place the number of dinosaur species at around 2000 (they hypothesize 1936 specifically — in the range [1543-2468]).

The method consists of pulling observations from [PaleoDB](https://paleobiodb.org/#/) and classifying them by location, age, and other features: The authors run Birth-Death (BD) simulations, adding to the outcomes of _Survival_ or _Extinction_ a third option, _Fossilization_, with a probability modeled by math that takes more than one line of LaTeX to explain. (Actually, it looks based on [the font](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/family.aspx?FID=360) that the authors wrote the formulas in MS Word, something I also noticed in the [MantisBot](http://blog.jordan.matelsky.com/365papers/5/) paper).

The paper introduced me to the _Common Cause_ hypothesis of paleontology — that the richness of samples found in a rock and the ease of interrogating that rock (as well as other factors) co-vary closely because they are caused by the same (potentially unknown) conditions. This is, of course, a huge confound for paleo statistics, I imagine; but the authors leverage it as a known-bias to inform their TRiPS model.

There are some very cool figures in this paper (if you're reading the bioarXiv version like I am, scroll all the way down) that chart species richness across time. This is really neat because the minima in the chart match known extinction events — _except_ for the Jurassic-Cretaceous extinction event, on which, claim the authors, this model casts doubt.
