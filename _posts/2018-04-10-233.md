summary: The brown bat superior colliculus contains specialized machinery that interleaves motor and sensory neurons for high-speed transfer of sensory and motor information between the systems.

I'm at the [BRAIN Initiative Investigators Meeting](http://www.braininitiative.org/events/pimeeting/) in DC and today I sat in on a fantastic talk by [Dr. Cynthia Moss](http://pbs.jhu.edu/directory/cynthia-moss/) on bat echolocation research. Prior work has shown that the _inferior_ colliculus has neurons that are selective to either echolocative calls _or_ social calls — but these cells did not respond to calls of the other type.
In this work, Moss demonstrates that cells in the _superior_ colliculus (SC) of big brown bats (_Eptesicus fuscus_) encode 3D information about target objects in a complex scene, and transit this information quickly between sensory and motor neurons in SC. Even within individual laminae, sensory and motor neurons interleave and exchange information at high speed.

This means that there is some complex specialized mechanism for echolocation in the bat brain that distinguishes between self-created and non-self sounds: Naturally, a bat needs to hear its own signals — but should ignore the echolocative signals of its peers and consider the social signals of its peers.

I want to also call attention to the complexity and awesomeness of the recording technolog used in this research: The Moss lab created wearable modules for the bats that didn't interact with flight or motion but were still able to record electrophysiology signals inside the brain.
