summary: Segmenting neuroimagery is hard. Determining airtight neurite boundaries makes the segmentation process way easier.

Image segmentation — grouping pixels by what they semantically represent in a scene — is a really big challenge in the world of neuroscience: Microscopy imagery is generally very dense, and very complex — two factors that make conventional computer-vision algorithms poor choices in computational neuroscience.

This paper breaks the challenge into two components: First, it computes a neurite boundary map; and second, it generates a segmentation that, the authors claim, competes with state-of-the-art (though they only demonstrate its performance on a [relatively small dataset](http://brainiac2.mit.edu/SNEMI3D/)).

If this work scales well — that is, it can be parallelized across massive datasets — then there is the possibility of this leading a paradigm-shift in EM neuroscience. But I don't see much evidence of seam-stitching in [their code](https://github.com/divelab/deepem3d), which is _in MATLAB_...which leads me to believe that this is optimized for a small-scope task, like the SNEMI3D dataset on which it was tested for this paper.

I realize I'm wearing my big-data-elitist hat right now because [I work so much with massive EM datasets](https://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/research-programs/microns), so let me take a step back and mention that in _most_ neuroimagery studies, this algorithm may be exceptionally useful _if_ the developers can come up with a way for it to run without a full MATLAB runtime.

And, to be very clear — I am very excited about this approach, which regards neurite boundaries as semantically important (whereas many existing algos treat all pixels equally, and dump everything into a massive net).
