[FashionBrain](https://fashionbrain-project.eu/) is a project that aims to bring big-data analysis to the generally lower-tech fashion industry by collating buyer preferences via social media, predict upcoming trends, and adjust internal product design to match that.

The envisioned project will include a variety of data acquisition systems — for instance, photo-based product search, matching known product catalogs for those seen in an image — as well as better search tools to navigate existing retailer websites and digital warehouses.

One of the main tasks of this project is to design a taxonomy for the categorization and organization of fashion-related data and databases. This taxonomy presents the novel contribution of eliminating the usual top-level gender-separation of objects, which reduces redundancy and is also a dumb idea anyhow.

The trend of data-access from this database over time can be used as a modelable time-series, which FashionBrain aims to predict to anticipate fashion trends.

To be completely transparent, I had a really hard time following the technical aspects of this paper; there's a _lot_ of buzzword salad (_"Hadoop, MapReduce, key-value stores and distributed (R)DBMSs are also often used for some data analytics..."_) and not too much technical detail on implementation. But I'm looking forward to seeing how this group uses [MonetDB](https://www.monetdb.org/Home) to address some of their scaling challenges.
