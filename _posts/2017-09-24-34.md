summary: Alzheimer's Disease datasets are growing in use and popularity, but the inhomogeneity of the data make reproducible science difficult. This paper is a step toward reproducible diagnosis.

This paper calls attention to the large number of recent irreproducible Alzheimer's (AD) ML-diagnosis papers, and laments the lack of interoperability between these datasets, classifiers, and conclusions. While _many_ research studies use the public ADNI data, the authors point out that ADNI is a heterogenous mix of patients, preprocessing pipelines, and metrics. To remedy this, the authors provide a way to convert ADNI brains into the BIDS format, another standard in brain-imaging.

The authors then provide a plug-and-play architecture for a BYO-classifier and feature extractor. This means that anyone can design their own algorithms and run them on a (more) homogenous BIDS dataset, enabling reproducible AD science.

In particular, I like how accessible [the code](https://gitlab.icm-institute.org/aramislab/AD-ML) is, both in terms of availability and in code-quality.
