summary: An LSTM-driven model improves upon the state-of-the-art for predicting the position of other road vehicles alongside an autonomous vehicle up to ten seconds in the future.

One of the main challenges of designing self-driving vehicles lives in the interim between when _no_ cars communicate their anticipated plans and when _all_ cars do. If no one knows what everyone else wants to do, we have the current system. If _everyone_ knows what everyone else wants to do, we (ostensibly) have a harmonious coexistance of all road vehicles. But if _some_ agents are predictable and others are not, what we have is a big mess.

This paper works on the challenge of predicting other cars' (both autonomous and human-driven) positions in the future, based upon their current position and their recent history.

This time-series challenge lends itself particularly well to an LSTM, since more recent timepoints will be more applicable to the future position of the car than older ones.

The model achieves a remarkable score — on average, it mispredicts the latitudinal position of a vehicle ten seconds in the future by only 70 centimeters, improving upon state of the art algorithms.

On the other hand, this model also encounters delays from time to time — sometimes reaching up to ten seconds. So the utility of this system in the short-term is unclear.
