summary: A Markov model based system can predict the complex trajectory of a vehicle moving along a road network.

The previous papers I've recently read on trajectory prediction ([#209](http://blog.jordan.matelsky.com/365papers/209), [#268](http://blog.jordan.matelsky.com/365papers/268)) have focused on neural network based machine learning.

This paper instead aims to predict the motion of entities — namely, cars across a map network — using a Markov model based approach, which clusters similar trajectories and then classifies newly observed trajectories into one of these clusters in order to easily begin to approximate _its_ unknown trajectory.

This system, named Traj-clusiVAT, guesses competitively with existing models when run on over 3 million passenger trajectories from a Singaporean taxi GPS dataset — potentially one of the largest trajectory prediction tasks ever.

This implementation is very interesting because it embeds trajectories in a network map rather than in continuous space, which means that the clusters can be represented by a single 'summary' path across the network, if I understand this work correctly.

This sort of prediction is key for identifying possible navigation situations before they happen: For example, this could enable traffic prediction before the traffic even became a problem. Or it could improve navigation in systems where there is _not_ a consistent GPS signal avaialble, such as dead-reckoning systems used in "offline mode" GPS.
