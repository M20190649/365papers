In this research, Janelia Research Campus imaging geniuses combined lattice light-sheet micrscopy (LLSM) with adaptive optics (AO), a technique in which a known shape is distorted through the sample, empirically undistorted at the other side, and this transformation is applied to the sample in order to refine the light-sheet-acquired images.

AO-LLSM enables incredible high-spatial- and temporal-resolution images taken in color 3D, limited only by the transparency of the sample (since the light-sheet microscopy still needs transparency in order to receives data from deeper tissue).

Honestly, I don't have a ton more to say about this paper â€” I've just been watching the videos of the data with my mouth hanging open. This looks like it could be a huge zap to the imaging world, since it means that we can explore extremely high-resolution 3D data with the spatial resolution to watch mitosis, organelle dynamics, neuron growth-cone formation and migration...

Go watch the videos. Trust me. This looks incredible.
