I was watching the [Nautilus](https://twitter.com/EVNautilus) [live stream](http://nautiluslive.org/) and they mentioned this paper: Cabrero De Leo spoke a bit about how the NEPTUNE site sparked investigations into the migration of copepods in the NE subarctic Pacific, in the area of Barkley Canyon.

Using Doppler and video data, the researchers used twenty months of data to identify the density of copapod distribution in the region of the NEPTUNE observatory over the course of days, months, and seasons.

Copepods — tiny millimeter-scale crustaceans — are known to migrate up and down in the water column over the course of the year: Because there are videos available from the 970m depth of the NEPTUNE observatory, it was possible to track the seasonal and annual variability of the population density at this depth, and use this information (in conjunction with ground-truth data from surface-level net assessments) to calibrate our understanding of how surface-level warming can affect the downward copepod migration, and thus the general regional ecosystem, which is largely fed by copepods.
