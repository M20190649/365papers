summary: Surgical residents performed about as well on a battery of alertness tests after 14 hour shifts as they did at the legal BAC limit.

One of the most common complaints about the state of medical training in the US (and of course elsewhere in the world too!) is that surgeons are expected to perform outrageous, long, onerous work hours. The literature generally suggests that continuity of care is extremely valuable for patient care and clinical outcomes, and the health-risk cost of switching physicians out is very high.

But in many cases, this leads to residents taking double-digit-hour shits at a time. Surely a 16th-hour surgeon performs at less than ideal capacity.

But in order to counter the knowlege that tag-teaming physicians is bad for patients, we need to know that sleepy surgeons are _worse_. So these researchers have proposed a "Fit-to-Perform" test, which compares the surgical abilities of a resident and benchmarks it with... booze.

The Mini-NeuroCart test evaluates concentration, coordination, mood, and other metrics (in some cases, self-evaluated). The authors compared a dozen surgical residents after a long shift, and after a few drinks.

The results are pretty clear: After long shifts (~14h), surgeons performed about as well as if they were at the legal blood-alcohol level limit (~0.5-0.8g/L). In many cases, the drunk residents performed better.
