In this 2006 paper, Leo Grady poses $n$-dimensional image segmentation as a graph-theory problem, and uses several models to improve performance of conventional watershed segmentation. In particular, he represents an image as a graph where edge-weights are some function $\omega$ on pixel $i$ with intensity $g$. In particular, the paper uses the Gaussian weight function as an example:

$$\omega_{ij} = exp(-\beta(g_i - g_j)^2)$$

This function can be replaced with any other function on pixels (e.g. incorporating color or local texture) as a pre-processing step on the graph.

Once these weights have been computed, "seeds" are placed in the graph (using manual placement). These seeds are then modeled in one of several ways:

**Diffusion.** The node can be represented as neighboring cells where diffusion takes place according to $\frac{du}{dt} = \nabla^2 u$. Just like diffusion is limited through porous membranes, this analogy makes the resultant segmentation robust to holes in boundaries in the image.

**Electric circuit.** Combining Kirchoff's and Ohm's laws, Grady derives a function to operate as a matrix-wise operation over a dense $n$-dimensional pixel space, essentially modeling each pixel as a nodal point with resistors connecting it to its neighbors.

These equations are combined in a MATLAB package the author freely distributes, but he notes that the operations take place in evaluated-MATLAB rather than compiled C, and are therefore much slower than a theoretical compiled counterpart (a $512\times512$ image takes ~2s to run on state-of-the-art 2006 hardware).

I like this work both because it models image segmentation using processes that mimic nature and because, in today's climate, non-neural-net approaches to image-segmentation are strangely uncommon to read about.
