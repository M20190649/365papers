Aphyonids are brotulas. Brotulas are Bythidita, which is a type of ophidiiform fishes.

Yikes I don't know _anything_ about fish terminology.

As soon as I saw the title of this paper from the tweet above, I realized I _had_ to read it — If I remember correctly, I had been watching the live stream of the _Okeanos Explorer_ when this Spooky Booger ([@Fishguy_FHL](https://twitter.com/Fishguy_FHL)'s words, not mine — though I wish I had thought of it) was discovered. (!!!) _Okeanos_' [live stream](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe_3CoEeinvPMze2u_aENBg) is such an amazing piece of modern open-science: You can watch the windshield view of an unmanned underwater ROV as the scientists back in mission-control explain to the audience (and each other!) what we're seeing.

In June 2016, at around 2500 meters below sea-level, _Okeanos_ transmitted a video feed of an aphyonid — a pale deep-sea swimfriend — the first time this species was seen in its natural habitat and alive. This animal was swimming close to the ocean floor quite slowly, and the differences in body marking suggested that this was a new species from other previously-characterized aphyyonids.  

Though I am a bit too far-removed from academic marine biology to really understand the implications of this discovery, it is _so cool_ that NOAA shares these research missions with the world. I had no idea what a _brotula_ was before watching this stream, and I probably forgot as soon as I turned off the stream. But when I read this paper, I felt the same inexplicable scientific pride that so many of us felt when _Curiosity_ landed on Mars.
